### Stage S1 output schema (YAML only)
Top-level keys MUST be exactly:
- context_pack_version: "S1.v2"
- generated_at_utc: string
- project_profile
- golden_sources
- source_audit
- formalism_index
- evidence_index
- cross_source_synthesis

Where:

project_profile:
  objective: "Develop a theory-first formal model to evaluate and solve Blackwell GPU architecture problems under CUDA>13 and PTX>9; output a 9-part academic LaTeX proposal."
  hard_constraints:
    architecture: "NVIDIA Blackwell (Grace-Blackwell allowed when relevant)"
    cuda: "> 13.0 (prefer 13.1+)"
    ptx: "> 9.0 (strict)"
    required_sources_each_run: [ARCH_BW, OPT_PIPE, NV_BLOG_TILE, NV_workloads, SEED_1, SEED_2, SEED_3]
  writing_constraints:
    latex_style: "academic, math-first"
    output_split: ">= 9 LaTeX parts; each LaTeX run emits exactly 1 part"
    citation_policy: "no uncited non-trivial claims; mark UNVERIFIED if not in sources"
  scope_boundaries:
    include: ["formal semantics/models", "layout algebra", "integer relations", "constraint optimization (SMT/ILP)", "cache/traffic modeling", "TMEM/TMA/tile IR as modeled objects", "scheduling (SWP/WS/CTA)"]

formalism_index:
  # For each source: list the formal objects it introduces/uses.

  # ... repeat for all sources.

evidence_index:
  # For each source: key claims + explicit limitations/open questions.
  # Mark any inference explicitly as INFERENCE; mark uncertainty as UNVERIFIED.
  ARCH_BW:
    key_claims: [{claim:"...", support:"...", blackwell_relevance:"...", confidence:"high|medium|low", notes:"..."}]
